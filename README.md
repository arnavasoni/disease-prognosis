A disease prognosis ML model.
Using Multinomial Naive Bayes.
One way that computers learn is called Naive Bayes. It's a bit like a game of guessing. Let me explain how it works.
Let's say you want to guess if a fruit is an apple or an orange. You might look at the color and the shape of the fruit to help you guess.
Naive Bayes is like that too! It looks at different things called "features" to make a guess. For example, if we wanted to guess if an email is spam or not, we might look at features like the words in the email, who it's from, and the subject line.
Naive Bayes uses all these features to make a guess, just like you used the color and shape of the fruit to guess if it was an apple or an orange.
It's called "Naive" because it makes a really simple assumption that all the features are independent of each other. This means that one feature doesn't affect the other features. It's not always true, but it makes the guessing game simpler.
So that's Naive Bayes in a nutshell! It's a way that computers can learn to make guesses by looking at different features, just like people do.
